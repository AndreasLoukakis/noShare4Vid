noShare4Vid
===========
note: this project is droped.

Basic code of http://noshare4vid.com/

It's an effort to avoid having to click Like / Share in order to view content, something that happens a lot specially within wordpress bloggers.

The aim of putting basic code here is to get any possible feedback for cases that this service can be extended or enhanced.

The server side parts are served from Laravel so i provide whatever I think is important to know.

The app is actually quite simple, getting the URL from an input, parsing it with simple html dom ( http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/ - check the controller file ) to find video id and then append it on the same page via js.

Any suggestions are welcome.
Cheers :)
